Lab 1: Getting familiar with Git
================================

Setup
-----
1. Click the __`Clone or download`__ button at the top of the repository and click the __`Download ZIP`__ option.

    (Make sure you get the ZIP for this lab - do not clone the repository.)

2. Extract the zip.

3. Open index.html from the extracted archive in Chrome or Firefox.

4. Open the developer tools for your browser and view the __Network__ tab.

5. Reload the page. Note the page makes a request to `www.google-analytics.com`.

Lab
---
When you downloaded the ZIP, Github packaged only the source code for the project. The project is not Git-aware on your filesystem.

Your tasks are as follows:

1. Convert the project into a git repository.
2. Create a new branch in the repository named `develop`. All code changes should be made in the `develop` branch.
3. Edit the page so that it no longer makes that request to `www.google-analytics.com`.
4. Commit your code changes to the repository.
